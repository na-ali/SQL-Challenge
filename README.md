# SQL Database Project for Employee Management

This project involves creating a relational database from scratch, focusing on the management of employee data. It includes data modeling, engineering, and analysis phases to structure, populate, and query a database containing information about employees, departments, salaries, and managerial relationships.

## Project Structure

### Data Modeling

- Developed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the structure of the database and the relationships between tables.

### Data Engineering

- Created SQL schemas for six main tables: `Employees`, `Departments`, `DepartmentEmployee`, `DepartmentManager`, `Salaries`, and `Titles`.
- Defined primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and other constraints to ensure data integrity and relationships between tables.
- Imported data from CSV files into the respective SQL tables, taking care to maintain the integrity of relationships through the correct import order.

### Data Analysis

Performed various SQL queries to analyze the data, including:
- Listing all employees with their details and salaries.
- Identifying employees hired in a specific year.
- Listing managers for each department.
- Showcasing the department association for each employee.
- Filtering employees by name criteria.
- Enumerating employees within specific departments.
- Counting the frequency of employee last names.

## Usage

After setting up the database, you can run the analysis queries located in the `queries` directory to explore the employee data. These queries cover a range of analyses, from basic listings of employee information to more complex aggregations.
